# ðŸ•“ FourQuad To-Do App â€“ Frontend

This is the **frontend** of the **Four Quadrants of Time Management** to-do list web application, built using **React.js** and styled with **TailwindCSS**. The interface is designed to help users categorize their tasks based on urgency and importance using the **Eisenhower Matrix** (Four Quadrants).

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** â€“ JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TailwindCSS** â€“ Utility-first CSS framework
- **Axios** â€“ HTTP client for API communication
- **Node.js / Express.js** (backend â€“ separate repo)
- **MongoDB** (backend database)

## Concept: Four Quadrants of Time Management

The UI displays 4 sections:
1. **Important & Urgent**
2. **Important but Not Urgent**
3. **Not Important but Urgent**
4. **Not Important & Not Urgent**

Each quadrant is managed independently and allows:
- ðŸŸ¢ Adding a task
- ðŸ”´ Deleting a task
- Marking a task as completed (optional, if implemented)
